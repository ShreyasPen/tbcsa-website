            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>At the Tampa Bay CS Club (TBCSC), we are dedicated to teaching and mentoring underprivileged students in the Tampa Bay area in computer science. We believe that access to education in fields like artificial intelligence, cryptography, and web development should not be determined by socioeconomic status. Our goal is to make computer science more accessible and to equip the next generation with the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly digital world.</p>
